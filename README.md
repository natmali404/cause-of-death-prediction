# Predicting the cause of death based on age and musical skill - data analysis and model fitting
## Course: System Analysis and Decision Support Methods
### Technologies: Python, Jupyter, LaTeX, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scikit-learn

The problem addressed in the research is the relationships between data on deceased musicians, including the causes of their deaths. The inspiration for these considerations was asking whether it is possible to effectively predict what a musician will die from, taking into account factors such as their age, place of residence, genre of music played, or musical skills.

The aim of this study is to analyze whether this data can be used to build a predictive model for the causes of death among musicians. By analyzing the acquired dataset, patterns and correlations are sought that may provide information on how these factors interact, and potentially influence the mortality of musicians. We will use various statistical methods to analyze the data, conduct experiments on them, and create a model.

The assumption is that there is some relationship between the deaths of musicians and the genre of music they engage in. For example, musicians performing hip hop or rock music are known for a more impulsive, risky lifestyle than jazz or classical musicians - therefore, such a relationship should emerge from our considerations.

### Individual stages of data acquisition and processing
a) Obtaining the first part of the data using a web scraping method
b) Obtaining the second part of the data using an API method
c) Data synthesis
d) Standardization of data
e) Removal of erroneous and empty data
f) Generalization/categorization of data
g) Repairing data formatting errors
h) Generating separate datasets (non-atomic data in columns, e.g., ”piano, guitar, vocals” in the ”musical skills” column, were split into atomic values to enable proper analysis)
